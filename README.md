# Carpooling Application in Java and JavaFX

Collaboratively developed a carpooling application in Java and JavaFX within a team of three, applying object-oriented programming principles and Scene Builder to efficiently address urban transportation challenges.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to create a carpooling application using Java and JavaFX to facilitate efficient urban transportation solutions. Key features included:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilized OOP principles to design and implement robust and scalable code architecture.
- **JavaFX and Scene Builder**: Developed the user interface using JavaFX and Scene Builder to create intuitive and user-friendly application screens.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated MySQL database for storing user information, ride details, and application settings.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Utilized GCP services for cloud hosting and deployment of the application.
- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: Implemented SMTP for email notifications and communication between users.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Java and JavaFX**: Developed front-end and back-end functionalities using Java and JavaFX.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism for modular and maintainable code.
- **MySQL**: Designed and managed a relational database schema for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deployed the application on GCP, leveraging cloud services for scalability and reliability.
- **SMTP**: Integrated email functionality using SMTP for user notifications and communication.
